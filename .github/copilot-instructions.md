We are building a Python package for end-to-end dataset creation, including data fetching, processing, and publishing. The package is primarily designed for anime-related datasets.

1. **Data Fetching**: We use libraries like `waifuc` and `gallery-dl` for fetching data from various sources. When providing examples or instructions related to data fetching, always prioritize these libraries.

2. **Data Processing**: For image processing, we are likely to use libraries such as `Pillow` or `OpenCV`. When suggesting image processing solutions, ensure compatibility with these libraries.

3. **Dataset Publishing**: For publishing datasets, we use tools like `huggingface-hub`. When providing examples for dataset publishing, include instructions for integrating with Hugging Face.

4. **Python Standards**: Always follow Python best practices, including type annotations, PEP 8 compliance, and clear, concise docstrings.

5. **Focus on Usability**: Provide examples and instructions that are beginner-friendly and easy to integrate into our workflow.
